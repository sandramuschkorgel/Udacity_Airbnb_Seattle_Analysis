# Seattle Airbnb Analysis
Airbnb is often considered an alternative to hotels, lodgings, or any other traveller's accomodation. Though this is true, Airbnb listings greatly differ due to their individuality. Each listing has a different host, location, service, amenities and the like - making each of them a unique experience. The underlying notebook tries to shed some light on how prices differ between different listings and which features influence prices as well as positive reviews the most.

## Description
The jupyter notebook lays out the entire CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) for an original Airbnb dataset. Therein are real Airbnb listings in and around Seattle from 2016. By running the notebook you are able to follow along each step in the process. You might as well jump to the modelling section directly, since I added the cleaned csv files to this repository.
